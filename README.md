# JunkBank - frontend repository

Welcome to the repository hosting the frontend part of our overarching big course project.

To swap between various versions (plain HTML, HTML+CSS, native javascript, React), checkout different branches with git.

Remember from the git course:

```
git branch
```

to list all available branches.


```
git checkout <BRANCHNAME>
```

to check out a version that you want to work with.

> Also remember to use `git pull -all` to get all the newest updates from all branches at once!
